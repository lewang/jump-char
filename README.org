* Why?
 Navigate by char.  The best way to "get" it is to try it.

* Interface

| key     | does                                                   |
|---------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| <char>  | move to the next match in the current direction.       |
| ;       | next match forward (towards end of buffer)             |
| ,       | next match backward (towards beginning of buffer)      |
| C-c C-c | invoke `ace-jump-mode' or `avy-goto-char' if available |

 Any other key stops jump-char and edits as normal.

C-c C-c switches to ace-jump-mode or avy-goto-char seamlessly.

The behaviour is strongly modeled after `iy-go-to-char' with the following
differences:

- point always stays before match
- point during search is same as after exiting
- lazy highlighting courtesy of isearch
